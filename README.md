# PlantDisPre
link for working prototype: https://plantdispre.herokuapp.com

an application to predict the health and disease of a plant
providing natural remidies to prevent those problems

Cite: We will use the PlantVillage dataset and it is a PyTorch implementation of Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection

We will be using Densenet121 and using transfer learning approach to train the neural network

installing PyTorch and loading the dataset from Google Drive
